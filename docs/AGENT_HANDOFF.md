# Agent Handoff

- **Branch:** `stabilize/colab-v2`
- **Application commit pinned by notebook:**
  `ff2642265a3cf377988de30a844a13a33ec34238`
- **Campaign:** `semantic-cs-idd-v3`
- **Notebook:** `notebooks/EdgeGuard_Master_Colab.ipynb`
- **Classification:** locally verified engineering delivery; real Colab GPU/training and
  Jetson evidence remain external. Remote CI and claim-safe notebook execution have not yet
  been re-run at this commit (see Local gates). A real L4 run at the prior commit
  (`b22fd12…`) passed the five-model AMP stack-probe (all five architectures, including
  PIDNet-S) and full data staging, then failed building `val_dataloader` for every
  model/stage with `TypeError: Pad.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument
  'seg_pad_val'`; this commit's fix for that failure is reproduced against the real pinned
  MMSeg checkout, not yet re-confirmed on real L4 hardware (see Local gates).

## What changed

- Replaced fourteen entry notebooks with one generated Run-all notebook.
- Added the `all` production orchestrator from preflight through final delivery packages.
- Reuses exact v2 Cityscapes/IDD audit candidates and verified Drive data without rescans.
- Requires all five canary, screening, and final models; HPO remains top-two.
- Added forced smoke interruption/resume evidence and general immutable checkpoint restore.
- Added owner-preauthorized exact-source/release policy while keeping official validation
  after model selection.
- Added five-model ONNX/golden-vector Jetson packaging, accepted Streamlit packaging, and
  measured thesis tables/figures/galleries.
- Added L4/High-RAM/disk gates and atomic Drive publication of final ZIPs.
- Replaced the hosted-Python project import with a standard-library-only runtime bootstrap.
- Runs restore and data preparation only after the verified Python 3.11 environment exists.
- Isolates v3 work state and preserves/skips incompatible commit-bound local/Drive state.
- Streams the real child error and packages stage, bootstrap and log-tail diagnostics.
- Resolves both `bin/uv` and Colab system-pip `local/bin/uv` private-prefix layouts and
  carries the verified executable path into the runtime installer.
- Prioritizes the pinned wheel's CUDA libraries over Colab's mutable toolkit paths while
  preserving host driver discovery.
- Reuses the hash-verified bootstrap receipt for canary execution instead of performing a
  second destructive package sync.
- Reports the exact failed module or CUDA initialization stderr and retains MMEngine's
  required `pkg_resources` path through the Setuptools 80.9.0 lock.
- Preserves failed canary evidence under a timestamped quarantine root before retry, so
  repeated Run-all attempts start with clean runtime evidence without deleting history.
- Firewalls Colab's hosted Matplotlib/Python/virtualenv/pip/uv state before bootstrap and
  every locked-runtime child; forces `Agg` and isolated cache roots.
- Runs a real headless PNG probe before the five-model canary and records the non-secret
  environment-contract identity in runtime evidence.
- Resumes correctly when the one permitted OOM batch reduction is followed by the forced
  smoke interruption; the resumed command and checkpoint identity are both verified.
- Marks every acceptance-mode phase `not_run`, preventing fixture execution from becoming
  measured or accepted scientific evidence.
- (This commit) Fixed two real training-blocking defects found by a Claude Code cross-file
  review: PIDNet-S's shared pipeline was missing `GenerateEdge`, crashing `PIDHead`'s
  boundary loss on the first optimizer step of any stage; the CE-vs-weighted-CE override
  only matched `CrossEntropyLoss`, silently no-oping for DDRNet-23-Slim and PIDNet-S, whose
  dominant losses are `OhemCrossEntropy`. Both were reproduced and fixed against the real
  pinned MMSeg checkout, not just inspected.
- (This commit) Added `tests/unit/test_mmseg_real_training_step.py`, the first test in the
  repository to run a real `model.loss()` forward/backward step per architecture against
  the real resolved MMSeg config; wired into `semantic-framework-cpu-probe.yml`.
- (This commit) The `stage-data` phase now verifies every manifest-referenced image/mask
  file exists on local disk instead of only checking the manifest JSON exists
  (`verify_manifest_data_is_staged`); Drive archive/shard copies now fail closed on a
  stalled read via a bounded stall-timeout guard instead of risking an indefinite hang.
- (Follow-up commit `1387322…`) Fixed `resize_train_ids()` validating against the wrong
  ID space (source label IDs instead of train IDs); reconciled `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `DATA_CATALOG.md`, and the eval-config resolution-mismatch docs found stale by the same
  review; recorded the IDD20K native-label-loss-on-shard-packaging limitation in
  `docs/TASKS.md` rather than acting on it (owner decision: needs a separate, costly
  Drive shard re-processing approval).
- (Commit `42be8d6…`) Raised `configs/rescue/semantic_first.yaml`'s `workers` from 2 to 6
  to use a Colab High-RAM instance's vCPUs more fully during data loading;
  `effective_batch` and every frozen HPO/step budget are unchanged. Confirmed training
  precision already defaults to bf16/AMP on CUDA (`train_model`'s `precision="auto"`), so
  no code change was needed there. Added `scripts/jetson/run_video_demo.py` (DEMO-02): a
  video-frame perception-overlay demo for ONNX Runtime (local/CPU, tested) and target-
  device TensorRT (human-gated per `scripts/jetson/AGENTS.md`, untested here).
- (Commit `b22fd12…`) A real L4 run at `42be8d6…` failed on PIDNet-S with "AMP/FP16
  stack-probe gradient is missing or non-finite" — `train_semantic.py::_probe_model`
  hardcoded `torch.float16` for its mixed-precision canary instead of following the same
  `precision="auto"` → bf16-on-capable-hardware policy `train_model` already uses, so it
  tested a precision (fp16) the real training run would never actually select on an L4.
  Extracted `edgeguard.rescue.mmseg_runtime.resolve_auto_precision()` and made the probe
  call it. This fix was later **confirmed on real L4 hardware**: the next run passed the
  five-model AMP stack-probe outright (`fp16_finite_model_count: 5`, all five architectures
  including PIDNet-S, GPU `NVIDIA L4`).
- (Commit `ff26422…`) That same real L4 run then failed building `val_dataloader` for
  every model/stage (first hit: `smoke`/`segformer_b0`) with
  `TypeError: Pad.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'seg_pad_val'`.
  `_evaluation_pipeline()` in `mmseg_runtime.py` passed `pad_val` and `seg_pad_val` as two
  separate constructor kwargs to the `Pad` transform; the pinned mmcv-lite `Pad`
  (`mmcv/transforms/processing.py`) only accepts a single `pad_val`, either a number or a
  `dict(img=..., seg=...)` — there is no `seg_pad_val` argument at all. Fixed by combining
  both into `pad_val={"img": 0, "seg": config.ignore_index}`; `_inference_pipeline()`'s
  plain `pad_val=0` was likewise made explicit as `{"img": 0}` for consistency (behavior
  unchanged — mmcv's `Pad` already treated a bare int as image-only padding). Reproduced
  and fixed against the real pinned MMSeg checkout by building both pipelines through
  `Compose()` with the mmseg registry scope active, the same way real training builds them
  — not yet re-confirmed on real L4 hardware.

## Local gates

- Ruff and format checks pass for the full repository.
- Mypy passes for all 116 configured source modules.
- Full pytest passes: 485 passed, 15 environment-gated skipped without the pinned MMSeg
  stack; 500 passed, 0 skipped with `EDGEGUARD_MMSEG_CHECKOUT` pointed at the pinned
  `c685fe6767c4cadf6b051983ca6208f1b9d1ccb8` checkout (includes the real per-architecture
  `model.loss()` tests). None of this exercises real CUDA/AMP behavior — that only happens
  on a real L4.
- Master notebook generation is byte-identical across two runs.
- The notebook SHA-256 after pinning is
  `d6a640ce064fc5e8fa252069d597f86a68a2059f9a2668bf6ada7a2bc3b2bd16`.
- **Pending at this commit:** claim-safe local cell execution has not been re-verified,
  remote Linux workflow `semantic-framework-cpu-probe.yml` has not been re-run, and the
  `Pad`/`seg_pad_val` fix itself has not been confirmed on real CUDA hardware — only the
  earlier AMP-probe fix has real-hardware confirmation so far. The prior application commit
  (`3f3ef8f…`) passed remote run `31129018003` with Colab's exact hostile inline backend
  and host uv/virtualenv state injected; that evidence does not carry over to this commit
  and should be re-established before a real Colab attempt.

## Next external action

Push this commit, then open the master notebook from the pushed branch in a fresh Colab L4
+ High-RAM runtime and use Run all (Colab Pro/Pro+ background execution is recommended so
the session survives closing the browser tab). The five-model AMP canary is already
confirmed passing; watch specifically whether `production-pipeline` now gets past building
`val_dataloader` (previously failed at `smoke`/`segformer_b0`) and proceeds through
training. If the session ends, repeat Run all in a new compliant runtime — this is a Colab
platform limit, not something the notebook can automate away. Do not change the notebook or
select stages manually.

Do not create `colab-v0.1.0-rc1` until two independent clean L4 sessions pass the exact
lock/five-model FP32/AMP canary and the real 50-step interruption/resume proof. After the
campaign completes, build TensorRT only on the target Jetson and attach actual 25W
telemetry. Do not merge, tag, open sealed datasets, upgrade JetPack, or change Jetson power
mode without a separate explicit decision.
